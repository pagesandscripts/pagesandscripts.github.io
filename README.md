# pagesandscripts.github.io

Static short story site served via GitHub Pages.

## Structure

- `index.html` – Landing page with featured art and story listings.
- `assets/css/` – Shared styles (`main.css`).
- `assets/images/` – Global art and photography used across the site.
- `assets/images/stories/` – Optional shared art for multiple stories.
- `stories/<story-name>/` – Individual story folders containing `index.html`, optional `custom.css`, and story-specific media.

Copy the `stories/story-template/` folder to create new stories without rebuilding the layout each time.
