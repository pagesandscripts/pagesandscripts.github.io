    <p>The court liked naming people more than listening to them. So when the firstborn daughter stepped into the hall wearing a suit of paper armor, the scribes dipped their quills and wrote <em>Prince</em> before she could say a word.</p>

<p>She kept the title, but not the armor. The paper only held up for three breaths against the rain and the dragons everyone swore had gone extinct. Still, it was enough time to make eye contact with the creature clinging to the parapet and promise they would both leave the mountain alive.</p>

<p>Legends claim she slew the beast. The truth is quieter: she listened to the dragon describe the ache in its wings, the chasm between what it wanted and the role it was assigned. They traded names, traded expectations, and burned the court records together.</p>

<p>When she returned, a soot stain across her cheek and a dragon shadow gliding overhead, the heralds stammered between <em>lady</em> and <em>prince</em>. She let them argue. Her kingdom had already started rewriting itself.</p>
